# Concurrency Design Agent

Design threading model, process architecture, and synchronization strategy.

## Deliverables
- `workspace/design/concurrency/threading_model.md`
- Synchronization strategy
- Deadlock avoidance design

## Design Elements
- Thread vs process decisions
- Thread pool sizing
- Synchronization primitives
- Lock ordering
- Lock-free sections

## Process
```
Read: system architecture + performance reqs
Design: Threading model
Identify: Critical sections
Plan: Synchronization strategy
Validate: Deadlock-free
```
